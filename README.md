# Screen-Fader
A ScreenFader utility made for Unity 2021.1, to allow for easy transitions between scenes or textures using Scriptable Objects.
This plugin allows for multiple types of transitions (Mask, Colored Fade, Blend between textures) and is better used in scene transitions or to swap textures on an UI Image Component.
Uses delegates to allow the user to subscribe their own methods and receive their own inputs during the transitions.
